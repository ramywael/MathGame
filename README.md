Description:
The Math Quiz Game is an interactive console-based application written in C++ that challenges users to solve arithmetic problems. It is designed to enhance mathematical skills through a fun and customizable quiz experience.

Features:

Customizable Quiz: Users can select:

1-The number of questions (up to 10).
2-Difficulty level: Easy, Medium, Hard, or Mixed.
3-Operation type: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, or Mixed.

.Dynamic Question Generation: Randomly generates math problems based on the selected settings.

.Real-Time Feedback: Displays whether the userâ€™s answer is correct or incorrect with color-coded feedback.

.Detailed Results: Provides a final summary of performance, including the number of correct and incorrect answers, and a pass/fail status.

Technical Highlights:

.Utilizes C++ enums and structures for clear and maintainable code.
.Implements random number generation for dynamic problem creation.
.Showcases control structures, input validation, and console manipulation for interactive user experiences.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to practice basic arithmetic or explore practical applications of C++ programming concepts.
